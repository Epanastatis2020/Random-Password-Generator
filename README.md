# Random-Password-Generator

This is a webpage made in Html, CSS and Javascript. The random password generator will generate a random password according to the length and content criteria as determined by the user.
​
## Contents
<p>
The app is composed of 1 page, index.html. It includes a javascript file, sciprt.js, which provides the functionality for the random password generator. Page styling is a mixed solution using Bootstrap and a CSS styles sheet, style.css. There is a free-use background image stored in the Assets folder.
</p>

## Objective
<p>
The goal in this project was to use javascript to produce a random password generator. Originally, the aim was to have the user determine the criteria via prompts, however I decided checkboxes and a slider would be a more suitable presentation.

## Summary of project
In this assignment, we were tasked to create a random password generator.

The password generator would take into account criteria such as length, and included character sets as determined by the user. 

The main challenge in this project was not simply creating the applicable character pool for the password generation, but ensuring that the generated password contained at least one character from each selected character set. This was achieved using RegExp - my first time using this functionality.
